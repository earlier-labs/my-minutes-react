*A personal time tracker that cuts down on procrastination and perfectionism through timeboxing.*

- New app offers users time management strategy
- Focuses on flexibility and ease-of-use to support tasks of all shapes and sizes
- Future updates will bring a rewards system and reporting

KITCHENER, ON - August 23, 2012 - Available today, [My Minutes](http://www.myminutesapp.com) provides iPhone users with a way to simplify time management. Through timeboxing, users specify time-based goals for their tasks. My Minutes cuts down on procrastination and perfectionism, while boosting productivity for tasks large and small.

**Features of My Minutes**

With a focus on flexibility and ease of use, My Minutes allows you to create "at least" goals for tasks that maximize time spent and "at most" goals for tasks that minimize time spent. This goal-oriented strategy lets you define an ideal day, and tracking time becomes an exercise in attaining the ideal.

The app also features a weekly motivational streak. Users build up series of green achievement dots as they hit daily goals.

Users can set tasks to repeat on any or all days of the week.

To keep weekly streaks alive, users can edit their goals are editable so that they remain achievable.

Tasks can also be tracked without goals, in case users just want to get an idea of where their time is going.

A daily notification reminds users of tasks scheduled that day, and running notifications alert users as they hit goals or come close to going over them.

Future updates of the app will add new features, including time reports tracking user performance over time, and a rewards system to earn extra leisure time by hitting set goals.

My Minutes is priced at $0.99 for a limited time and runs on devices running iOS 5.1 and up.
